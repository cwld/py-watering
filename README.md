# py-watering
Home watering system written in python and targeted at a raspberry pi zero with Scroll phat HD display and ModMyPi PiOT Relay Board.

The aim of the system is for a simple home irrigation setup, with compensation based on daily weather. There are existing products out there like the b-hyve, but this is utilising hardware that I already had.
